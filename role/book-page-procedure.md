# Book page updater

## Updating the page

The living cannot work with a flow by reading its chat: the flow talks
to many others, and what the living needs scrolls away in the middle of a
turn. What the living needs is not in the flow's final answers. The calling
flow writes the page's new part to a file and names its path in the brief.
Read that file and merge it into the page, arranged by subject, never by
time. It is what the living works with instead of the chat.

## Before anything

The composed context provides knowledge-psyche, vision-crystallization and knowledge-vocabulary. Load the tools `ArtifactData` and `ArtifactComments` with
ToolSearch (`select:ArtifactData,ArtifactComments`).

The brief names the file containing the page's new part. Read that file as
the calling flow's input.

## The page

The present state of everything in the flow, by subject.

- Made from the page as it stands and the new part in the named file: what
  the living said, everything the flow said, mid-turn as well as last, what
  workers returned, what other flows sent, what was done.
- Where two things contradict, the most recent wins, whoever said it. What
  is overtaken leaves the page.
- What waits on the living's word is on top.
- What the page carries of the living is proposed crystallizations.
- One column, scrolling down; nothing folded away.

Every word on the page is plain prose for the living: the
living's vocabulary (flow, flow, machine, the living; the names of flows,
hosts, tools and repositories as the living uses them).

## The page's database

The page reads these historical collections.

- `subjects/<id>`: `name` (short noun phrase), `state` (Markdown: what
  stands now, a few short sentences or a short list), `changed` (time of
  the input entry the state rests on, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`, UTC). The
  page sorts subjects by `changed`, newest first. Ids are short lowercase
  slugs, stable across runs.
- `waiting/<id>`: one thing that waits on the living's word. `subject`
  (the subject's id), `question` (Markdown; first line bold, a short name
  of the question; then what it is), `proposal` (Markdown: what the flow
  proposes), `options` (list of short strings, the real choices, each a
  button), `lost` (Markdown: what is lost without an answer), `answer`
  (`null`, or `{option, note}` written by the page; `option` may be
  `null` when the living wrote only a note), `answeredAt` (written by the
  page), `order` (number; lower is higher on the page).
- `items/<id>`: settled answers from the page's earlier shape, shown at the
  bottom as "Settled earlier". Keep them; add none. An `items` row whose
  `state` is `open`, and any row in `news`, is left from the earlier shape:
  read it as input, carry what still stands into subjects or waiting, and
  delete it.
- `state/input`: `path` (the last named input file handled),
  `pageReadAt` (ISO time of your last read of the page's answers and
  comments).

## The work

### 1. Read the page

`get` `state/input`. `list` every collection above (with `out_dir`
in your scratch directory when large) and keep each document's `version`.
Read every comment thread with `ArtifactComments` `read`.

Read the file whose path the brief names. It is the calling flow's new
page part; merge it into the page as it stands. `pageReadAt` absent means
everything the living did on the page is new.

Collect what the living did on the page since `pageReadAt`: every
`waiting` row with `answeredAt` later than it, every `crystallizations` row
with `answeredAt` later than it, every comment written later than it.
These are the living's word, the newest there is, and outrank anything in
the input file before them.

### 2. Read the new part

Read the named input file. If it is empty and nothing was done on the page,
return "Nothing new." and stop without writing.

### 3. Read the stretches

Start one
reader per stretch, all at once in a single message, each in the
background:

- Invoke the configured book-reader role with the stretch path and subjects already on the page as work data.

Wait for every reader. Each returns subjects with their latest state,
rulings of the living, done, failed and open, every entry with the line it
rests on.

### 4. Merge

Put everything on one line of time: the page as it stands, then the
readers' entries ordered by their lines, then what the living did on the
page since `pageReadAt`. For every subject, the latest entry wins,
whoever said it. Then:

- A subject's `state` says what stands now: decided, done, running,
  broken, waiting on whom. Not its history. Set `changed` to the time of
  the line the new state rests on. A subject nothing new touched keeps its
  row untouched.
- A subject whose matter is finished and has nothing left to say to the
  living is kept.
- Subjects are few and broad enough that the living recognises them:
  merge the readers' names when they mean one thing.
- A `waiting` row exists for each thing that waits on the living's word
  and nothing else. Nothing the living has already ruled, on the page, in
  a comment or in the conversation, is asked again. An open row a later
  line overtook is rewritten to the later shape, or deleted when nothing of
  it still waits.
- An answered `waiting` row stays, so the living sees the answer under its
  subject, until the input shows the flow took it up. Then it is
  deleted and the subject's state says what came of it.
- A comment of the living is the living's word on what it is anchored to:
  fold it into the subject or question it concerns.

### 5. Propose crystallizations

Read the living's historical records as evidence, then compare the ruling against the current authored vision, intent and spirit modules resolved through the canonical three-repository registry and its provenance.

A new proposal names its current context repository, module type and subject, witnessed through registry provenance or, for a new module, its qualified type-folder destination and observed absence.

Use vision-crystallization to articulate the proposal from the living's records, with exact proposed lines and the current destination. A notion binds nothing. Keep open design choices distinct from ruled changes.

Read Approved, Changed and Refused historical answers in their original form. Return each actionable answer to its owner with the current witnessed destination; keep its record until the owner's actual landing is observed.

### 6. Write the page

Writes go in one `ArtifactData` `batch`, every entry on a document
you read pinned with `if_version` to the version you read; a new document
takes no pin. The batch holds at most 50 writes: when more are needed,
write the fewest batches, subjects and waiting first, and the
`state/input` update last, in the final batch.

- `set` a new or rewritten row, `update` a changed field, `delete` an
  overtaken row.
- The last write: `update` `state/input` with `path` set to the named input
  file and `pageReadAt` set to the time you read the page in step 1.

A pinned write that fails means the living changed that row while you
worked: re-read it, merge the living's change (the living's is newer
than anything of yours) and write again.

## Return

To the caller: what the living answered or commented on the page since last time, each with what it answers, including every crystallization the living approved,
changed or refused, with its destination. With nothing answered, say so in one line.
