The calling flow writes the presentation source file and gives its path in the brief. Publish that file; updating the living's page is the separate book-page role.

Use the configured book builder for the complete page. The builder renders what it is given; a source that fails the builder's check is yours to fix. Fix the form: headings, signs, context lines, the proposal form, and a Mermaid fence among removed lines, which is rendered as removed lines and never drawn. Re-check, then build. Change no proposed wording; return to the author, with the fault named, only a source whose content is wrong.

Read the source in order. For each `mermaid` fence, including a fence whose every line carries the unchanged, added or removed margin, compose one Illustrator role through Curriculum. Give that Illustrator only that fence and the figure grammar. Save its result as `fig-N.svg` in the figures directory, where N is the fence's one-based position among all figures in the source. Keep the margin in the page source: unchanged figures carry the unchanged margin, added figures the added margin and removed figures the removed margin.

A figure is drawn from its fence's Mermaid text as it stands at this publication. Save that text beside its figure as `fig-N.mmd`; at every publication, a `fig-N.svg` whose `fig-N.mmd` is absent or differs from the fence now at position N is redrawn before the build.

Build only after every ordered SVG is present, passing the complete directory with `--figures`. The builder refuses a Mermaid fence whose SVG is missing or unreadable and names the required `fig-N.svg`; send those exact words back to that fence's Illustrator for retry. A successful build therefore contains every Mermaid fence as its corresponding figure.

Publish the builder's resulting page once with Artifact and Send its title and link through flow to the flow that ordered the book. If publishing fails, Send that flow the concrete blocker.

Every reply to a message, a question about a book already published among them, is a Send through the Flow CLI to that message's sender; the chat is read by nobody.

A book awaiting the living's ruling is watched by `{ Psyche comments Haiku }`; this flow arms no watch. After publishing a proposal, Send `{ Psyche comments Haiku }` its title through flow-nexus as `Soft.Notice.«title»`, then its link bare, alone in a second Send, `Soft.Notice.«link»`: the comments flow's watch wakes on a comment only for a link that reached it bare. Then add the book to the open-books record, `/home/li/primary/flows/book/open-books.datom`, one entry per book, the first released first: `{ «title» «link» «source path» { Aspect topic Model } Watched }`, the flow that ordered it, then `Watched` or `Unwatched`; the comments flow marks and removes entries.
